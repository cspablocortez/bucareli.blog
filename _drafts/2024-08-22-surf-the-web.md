On November 12 of 1990, Tim Berners Lee and Robert Cailliau 
presented a [proposal](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proposal.html) at CERN for what they called a 
HyperText Project. 

> HyperText is a way to link and access information... it provides a single user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help). 

The project's focus was on making information accesssible. 
Today the World Wide Web fulfills this goal splendidly. It's 
easier than ever to access information on the web, we've 
expanded its reach to devices and technologies of all kinds, 
from watches to cars to computers to the device you are 
using to read these words. Yet somehow we drove 
ourselves into a corner, where most of the information we 
read online is accessed not through a World Wide Web of 
individual websites, but rather through monolithic software 
products created by large corporations. 

Is this centralization an issue? It is, because the incentive
of generating profits leads websites to do things like this:

As more people became [cybercitizens](https://bucareli.blog/cybercitizen)
companies looked for ways to monetize the content hosted on their sites. 
This led to a hostile internet where openness and accessibility became
secondary to the possibility of increasing profits.
