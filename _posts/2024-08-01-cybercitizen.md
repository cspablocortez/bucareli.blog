In the information age, we have been steadily working towards an inhospitable future for offline existence. Points of entry to cyberspace have made themselves readily accessible in our smartphones, our computers, our televisions, and in the internet of things. We have collectively contributed to this vast digital network of human expression with data &mdash;ours and the data of those around us. The digital component of life today is a permanent aspect of human interactions, and this in turn creates the need for analyzing the way we live this hybrid existence. 

Broadly speaking, people have taken to the internet for obligations, for leisure, for socialization, for expression, and for politics. In its current state, cyberspace is a place for *being* when *being* cannot happen offline. It is, however, not a mere replacement for offline interactions. **Cyberspace is a complimentary component of the human experience**, as some things are better done online while others should probably stay within the bounds of the physical world. One thing is certain: The current separation between digital and physical spaces will continue to evolve, and we ought to prepare for these changes. Consider the times that your digital life plays an important role in your daily routine. Job applications, apartment hunting, loan payments, entertainment, work, education, mortgage contracts, even meeting people for the first time can be done through cyberspace. It's not likely that this will change anytime soon. Whether this impossibility for offline existence is overall a good or a bad thing is a topic for another entry. Here, I want to address our obligation to reflect and think about what **cyberconstituency** entails. 

What does it mean to be a cybercitizen? Can I opt out of existing digitally? How can I be a good cybercitizen? Why should I want to be a good cybercitizen anyway?
