In the information age, we have been steadily working towards an inhospitable future for offline existence. Points of entry to cyberspace have made themselves readily accessible in our smartphones, our computers, our televisions, and in the internet of things. We have collectively contributed to this vast digital network of human expression with data &mdash;ours and the data of those around us. The digital component of life today is a permanent aspect of human interactions, and this in turn creates the need for analyzing the way we live this hybrid existence. 

Broadly speaking, people have taken to the internet for obligations, for leisure, for socialization, for expression, and for politics. In its current state, cyberspace is a place for *being* when *being* cannot happen offline. It is, however, not a mere replacement for offline interactions. **Cyberspace is a complimentary component of the human experience**, as some things are better done online while others should probably stay within the bounds of the physical world. One thing is certain: The current separation between digital and physical spaces will continue to evolve, and we ought to prepare for these changes. Consider the times that your digital life plays an important role in your daily routine. Job applications, apartment hunting, loan payments, entertainment, work, education, mortgage contracts, even meeting people for the first time can be done through cyberspace. It's not likely that this will change anytime soon. Whether this impossibility for offline existence is overall a good or a bad thing is a topic for another entry. Here, I want to address our obligation to reflect and think about what **cyberconstituency** entails. 

What does it mean to be a cybercitizen? Can I opt out of existing digitally? How can I be a good cybercitizen? Why should I want to be a good cybercitizen anyway?

I use the terms “cyberspace” and “cybercitizen” following the definitions in philosopher Pierre Lévy’s 1997 book *Cyberculture*. There, Lévy defines cyberspace as “the medium of communications that arose through the global interconnection of computers” (p. 16). A cybercitizen is a participant of this communication medium. Because there is a distinction between the terms Internet, World Wide Web, Gopher, Gemini, and any future communication protocols that may exist, the term cyberspace allows for a technology-agnostic discussion on information exchange facilitated by computer communication protocols. For example, if the metaverse becomes the de facto communication protocol in a few decades, the ideas discussed in this entry will remain applicable. 

A person becomes a cybercitizen when there is an exchange of personal data for usage of some digital service. Regardless of the frequency of this transaction, once it has been carried out at least once, the cybercitizen may not readily renounce their place in cyberspace. More concretely, once the discrete exchange of personally identifying information such as phone number, home address, or credit card has been given up in exchange for access to a service, a person becomes one more node in the vast repository of information travelling through the digital space. Because I assume my reader will find themselves in this category, in the following sections I offer some thoughts on cyberconstituency, or the relationship that a person has to cyberspace.
