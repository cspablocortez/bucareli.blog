RE: Fish: A tap essay

Things just are. We don't point them out, let's be subtle.

I'm not sure why I have been so afraid of "speaking" on the 
web. I don't know my own voice.

I'm told by these tests that my writing is kind. 

If you want to learn what people are talking about, how do 
you go about it?

We should get clear about what this question means by 
defining who "people" refers to. But the "who" depends on 
that *what*. What is the topic? First we get clear on the 
topic, and this should inform who 
we will refer to to learn what is being said about the 
topic.
