Bucareli is a blog about cyberspace. 

The name is taken from Bucareli Avenue in Mexico City, 
inspired by its fictional analogue in Roberto Bola√±o's 
novel *The Savage Detectives*.

This website started the way nowadays someone would say 
"we should start a podcast". In other words, the kind of
thing you say and consider with friends for a few moments 
before bursting out in a laughter that somehow
contains both an acknowledgement of the ridiculousness of the 
prospect along with a slight disappointment because
deep down we all know it *would* be pretty cool to have
a podcast.

But instead of a podcast the talk was about blogs, like
the ones of the early 2000s, when a blog was made by
one person with an interest or a hobby. More creative outlet
than website. A technical experiment.

The Wiby search 
engine describes the period like this:

> In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but **finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens.** In addition, many pages today are created using bloated scripts that add slick cosmetic features in order to mask the lack of content available on them. Those pages contribute to the blandness of today's web.


Unironically, we missed *surfing* the web.
