Bucareli is a blog about cyberspace.

The name is taken from Bucareli Avenue in Mexico City, 
inspired by its fictional analogue in Roberto Bola√±o's 
novel *The Savage Detectives*.

This website started the way nowadays someone would say "we 
should start a podcast", the kind of thing you say and 
consider with friends for a few moments before bursting out 
in a laughter that somehow contains two feelings: an 
acknowledgement of the ridiculousness of the prospect along 
with a slight disappointment because deep down we all know 
it *would* be pretty cool to have a podcast.

But instead of a podcast the talk was about blogs, like
the ones of the early 2000s, when a blog was made by
one person with an interest or a hobby. More creative outlet
than website. A technical experiment.

The [Wiby search 
engine](https://wiby.org/?q=) describes the period like this:

> In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but **finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens.** In addition, many pages today are created using bloated scripts that add slick cosmetic features in order to mask the lack of content available on them. Those pages contribute to the blandness of today's web.


Unironically, we missed *surfing* the web. We missed 
stumbling upon unknown and exciting information shared on a 
website created by one or many strangers motivated by 
curiosity about a new technology.

On November 12 of 1990, Tim Berners Lee and Robert Cailliau 
presented a [proposal](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Proposal.html) at CERN for what they called a 
HyperText Project. 

> HyperText is a way to link and access information... it provides a single user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help). 

The project's focus was on making information accesssible. 
Today the World Wide Web fulfills this goal splendidly. It's 
easier than ever to access information on the web, we've 
expanded its reach to devices and technologies of all kinds, 
from watches to cars to computers to the device you are 
using to read these words. Yet somehow we drove 
ourselves into a corner, where most of the information we 
read online is accessed not through a World Wide Web of 
individual websites, but rather through monolithic software 
products created by large corporations. 

Is this centralization an issue? It is, because the incentive
of generating profits leads websites to do things like this:

As more people became [cybercitizens](https://bucareli.blog/cybercitizen)
companies looked for ways to monetize the content hosted on their sites. 
This led to a hostile internet where openness and accessibility became
secondary to the possibility of increasing profits.
