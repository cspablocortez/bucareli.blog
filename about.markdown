## History

This website started the way nowadays someone would say "we 
should start a podcast", the kind of thing you say and 
consider with friends for a few moments before bursting out 
in a laughter that somehow contains two feelings: an 
acknowledgement of the ridiculousness of the prospect along 
with a slight disappointment because deep down we all know 
it *would* be pretty cool to have a podcast.

But instead of a podcast we were talking about blogs, like
the ones of the early 2000s, when a blog was made by
one person with an interest or a hobby. More creative outlet
than commercial venture. A technical experiment in self-expression.


The [Wiby search 
engine](https://wiby.org/?q=) describes the period like this:

> In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. 

> Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but **finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens.** 

> In addition, many pages today are created using bloated scripts that add slick cosmetic features in order to mask the lack of content available on them. Those pages contribute to the blandness of today's web.

Unironically, we missed *surfing* the web. We missed 
stumbling upon unknown and exciting information shared on a 
website created by one or many strangers motivated by 
curiosity about a new technology. 

This is hard to do now because most of our time online revolves around 
the same few apps, and the new websites we find through search engines
are more concerned with advertising revenue than providing a good
experience for visitors. That is why they ask you to accept cookies, 
to disable your ad blocker, to accept notifications, or even to sign up 
for an account before accessing the site.

But none of those things are necessary for making a website. I want
support an open web that promotes free communication for all its 
[cybercitizens](/cybercitizen). My small contribution to this goal
is this blog. 
This blog has no trackers, no analytics, and no JavaScript.

## About the Author

My name is Pablo E. Cortez,

A lot of my time is spent studying how people
interact with each other (and with computers!) in digital environments.
